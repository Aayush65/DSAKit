# DSA Kit (Data Structures and Algorithms Kit)

## Overview

DSA Kit is a comprehensive collection of Python modules that implement various data structures and algorithms from scratch. The primary goal of this project is to provide efficient and well-optimized implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- Developed all data structures as Python modules using best-known algorithms.
- Ensured efficient Time and Space complexities for all implemented algorithms.
- Comprehensive modules for Linked Lists, Binary Trees, and Tries with essential functions not available in Python's standard library.
- Implemented default data structures like HashSet, HashMap, Circular Deque, and Min/Max Heap.
